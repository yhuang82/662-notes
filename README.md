### Lecture 1 Introducing Security operations and the SOC

* SOC = security operations center;  
is a centralized unit that deals with security issues on both an organizational level and a technical level. Use people,process, and capabilities to deliver one or more services.  
Organizations leveraging more technology require the need for SOC: IOT growth quickly.  
reason for SOC dysfunctional:  
1. lack of educational security professional  
2. organization should defend against all parts instead of assuming SOC can prevent 100% of the exploitation  
3. SOC can not meet current demand: resulting in poor reporting, dysfunctional tools, and analyst burnout;  
4. organniza move to cloud service didnot think of the security;  

* Investing in security:  
1. information assurance: CIA of information;  
2. Defense in depth strategy: protect data, a SOC using people, processes and technology to create different layers of defense, one layer  fail another layer steps in.
