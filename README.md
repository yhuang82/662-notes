### Lecture 1 Introducing Security operations and the SOC

* SOC = security operations center;  
is a centralized unit that deals with security issues on both an organizational level and a technical level. Use people,process, and capabilities to deliver one or more services.  
Organizations leveraging more technology require the need for SOC: IOT growth quickly.  
reason for SOC dysfunctional:  
1. lack of educational security professional  
2. organization should defend against all parts instead of assuming SOC can prevent 100% of the exploitation  
3. SOC can not meet current demand: resulting in poor reporting, dysfunctional tools, and analyst burnout;  
4. organniza move to cloud service didnot think of the security;  

* Investing in security:  
1. information assurance: CIA of information;  
2. Defense in depth strategy: protect data, a SOC using people, processes and technology to create different layers of defense, one layer  fail another layer steps in.  

Threats exploit vulnerabilities, SOC can detect and prevent this from happening;  
Signature detection; bahavior detection; anomaly detection.  

* Maturity assessment frameworks:  
Organization need develop their own maturity-grading structure and work on improving security what they need: identify(managing sys;ppl;data); protect(defending services); detect(how to identify a specific event occurred); respond(action taken when an incident is detected).  

* Different stages of cyber kill chain model: reconnaissance; weaponization; delivery; exploitation; installation; command and control; actions and objectives.  
The best way to choose a treat model is to be outcome-focused and match the best approach based on obtaining your desired outcome.  

* Vulnerabilities and risks: all organizations have vulnerabilities and there will never be a point when all vulnerabilities can be identified and patched.  

* SOC service: Risk management, vulnerability management, incident management, analysis, compliance, digital forensics, situational and security awareness, research and development;  

SOC maturing models:  
1. first gen soc: monitors device logs,
2. second gen: leverages data correlation and consolidation toturn log data into security events.
3. third gen: offers more service, such as vulnerability management and compliance.
4. four: leverages the latest SOC tech and services and expands visibility to other network using threat intelligence, reputation security cloud sec.  

* SOC goal assessment:  
1. standards not always change with the same pace of the tech;
2. make sure the investment goal meet the focus of the business;
3. with establishing and ranking the goals of the business and SOC, the organization can align security tools to that list to provide a roadmap for how each security need should be addressed and in what order.  
* SOC goal assessment process:  
1. meet with SOC executive sponsor to confirm BG;
2. develop SOC goals, and IT goals;
3. create IT processes representing the more detailed documentation;
4. identify any missing people, process or technology. 

* SOC capability assessment:  
1. create a capability map;
2. perform gap anaylsis;
3. identify priorities;
